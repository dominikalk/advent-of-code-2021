I decided to take part in the advent of code in 2021. This repository contains all solution, input and description files for each day of the advent. 

To run the solutions either run:
```
python3 all_solutions.py
```
and follow the prompt to either run the solution for one day or all of them
or run:
```
cd [day folder]
python3 solution.py
```
to run the solution for a specific day.

Note: the python command `python3` may be different depending on the configurations on your machine. Simply `python` or `py` may work. These files require python 3 to be installed.
